So, I have been working on the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate course in Coursera and I have finished all of the courses, except the last one.
In the final course, they suggest creating a portfolio to showcase the ability and the understanding of how data analytics work in real life. They give study cases to us to do and include it in our portfolio when we are finished. 

So, I chose to pick Cyclistic, a fictional company based in Chicago. In this case study, I work as a junior data analyst in the marketing team of Cyclistic. The top managers think member riders are much more profitable, so they want to find a way to convert casual riders to member riders. My job for this case is to gain insights and identify the trend from the provided data to help our marketing team to deploy their marketing strategy.

First, I downloaded all the 15 historical data files, 2020/4 -2021/05, from the company cloud server. Because it contains over 4 million rows of data, Excel is not going to be the ideal tool to clean the data unless I do it file by file and is going to take a while.  

Instead of doing it on my laptop, I used Google Bigquery,a fully-managed, serverless data warehouse that enables scalable analysis over petabytes of data to combine and clean the data. 

**I first megered all the 15 files by uisng union all function.**
